models:
  - name: data_monitoring_metrics
    description: >
      Elementary anomaly detection tests monitor metrics such as volume, freshness and data quality metrics.
      This incremental table is used to store the metrics over time.
      On each anomaly detection test, the test queries this table for historical metrics, and compares to the latest values.
      The table is updated with new metrics on the on-run-end named handle_test_results that is executed at the end of dbt test invocations.

  - name: metrics_anomaly_score
    description: >
      This is a view on `data_monitoring_metrics` that runs the same query the anomaly detection tests run to calculate anomaly scores.
      The purpose of this view is to provide visibility to the results of anomaly detection tests.

  - name: anomaly_threshold_sensitivity
    description: >
      This is a view on `metrics_anomaly_score` that calculates if values of metrics from latest runs would have been considered anomalies in different anomaly scores.
      This can help you decide if there is a need to adjust the `anomaly_score_threshold`.

  - name: monitors_runs
    description: >
      This is a view on `data_monitoring_metrics` that is used to determine when a specific anomaly detection test was last executed.
      Each anomaly detection test queries this view to decide on a start time for collecting metrics.

  - name: schema_columns_snapshot
    description: >
      Stores the schema details for tables that are monitored with elementary schema changes test.
      In order to compare current schema to previous state, we must store the previous state.
      The data is from a view that queries the data warehouse information schema.
      This is an incremental table.

  - name: filtered_information_schema_columns
    description: >
      Queries the columns view from the information schema of the schemas in the project.
      This view is generated using an adapter specific macro, as information schema is different between platforms.
      This is a view to make the work with the information schema more convinient.

  - name: filtered_information_schema_tables
    description: >
      Queries the tables and schemas views from the information schema of the schemas in the project.
      This view is generated using an adapter specific macro, as information schema is different between platforms.
      This is a view to make the work with the information schema more convinient.
